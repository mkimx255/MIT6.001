Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

The following variables contain values as described below:

balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card

annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal

For each month, calculate statements on the monthly payment and remaining balance. At the end of 12 months, print out the remaining balance. Be sure to print out no more than two decimal digits of accuracy - so print

Remaining balance: 813.41
instead of

Remaining balance: 813.4141998135
So your program only prints out one thing: the remaining balance at the end of the year in the format:

Remaining balance: 4784.0
A summary of the required math is found below:

Monthly interest rate= (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
Minimum monthly payment = (Minimum monthly payment rate) x (Previous balance)
Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum monthly payment)
Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)

    # Test Case 1:
	      balance = 42
	      annualInterestRate = 0.2
	      monthlyPaymentRate = 0.04

	      # Result Your Code Should Generate Below:
	      Remaining balance: 31.38

          # To make sure you are doing calculation correctly, this is the
          # remaining balance you should be getting at each month for this example
            Month 1 Remaining balance: 40.99
            Month 2 Remaining balance: 40.01
            Month 3 Remaining balance: 39.05
            Month 4 Remaining balance: 38.11
            Month 5 Remaining balance: 37.2
            Month 6 Remaining balance: 36.3
            Month 7 Remaining balance: 35.43
            Month 8 Remaining balance: 34.58
            Month 9 Remaining balance: 33.75
            Month 10 Remaining balance: 32.94
            Month 11 Remaining balance: 32.15
            Month 12 Remaining balance: 31.38
